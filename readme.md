[Week 1 Project](https://github.com/jimmyvluong/advanced_sql_2024/tree/main/Week%201)

Questions/Reflection:
1. For project 1, there's a key step to lower(trim()) combination of sql functions to clean the joins on city and state. What are things we can do to anticipate or watch out for or detect this?
- Idea: Leading space tester - seems more intuitive to do this in Python with a looping function?
